# mysql-mikrotik-usercron
This is another simple script written to take user-login from a student database to a mikrotik router so that they can be able to login without them storming the ICT for hotspot passwords. we have more than 3000 users, i'll let your imagination run. 

I will appreciate comments and critisizim about this software and how i can make it better. kindest regards
